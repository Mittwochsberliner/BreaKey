Hello!

You may have some questions, such as:
What is BreaKey?
Why did you make this?
What is any of this?
How is this all connected to One Piece, the MLB, and (potentially) the Backstreet Boys?

Breakey is a (board) game from about 2002-2005, made in the Netherlands. It was dicontinued around February 2005, and this is a fan attempt to re-create the physical game in digital form, due to it's limited supply and general unavailability.

This was all started by Kam Sandwhich's "Worst Board Game Of All Time 2" tournament. One of the competitors was the afformentioned BreaKey. Some people from his discord (including me) did some research to try and find more information about the board game. This was all compiled in "The BreaKey Files", here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZLwNWe7lXgS8P6fgF-eWym5YYZvAahegHUjOr3KFdI/edit?usp=sharing

If you want to contact me, the best way would be through my discord account "mittwochsberliner".
